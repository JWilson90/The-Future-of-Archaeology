title: The Future of Digital Archaeology: Ethical, Sustainable, and Responsible
---
# Accessibility, Ethics, and Responsibility

Unquestionably, digital archaeology will be more available to the public.  Many of the I findings of archaeological discoveries have been printed in newspapers, journal articles, and more recently social media.  Technology has driven our society towards an internet fueled information sharing community.  However, there are issues surrounding this idea of information sharing in terms of archaeology.  The further sharing and technology based information must be controlled by the archaeologists themselves.  Misinformation is a large issue in the world of social media, and to ethically convey an informative message, there must be the proper research accomplished before sharing such information.  Opposed to “clickbait” type information, archaeology must engage people in an engaging way, but at the same time keep the content intelligent and well informed.

In order to keep the field of archaeology responsible and sustainable, content should be fact-checked before posting them online.  This is done already in large corporations, and academics of archaeology should be held to the same standard.  The digitalization of archaeology seems inevitable.  It is up to the public and archaeologists to hold themselves accountable for the content they wish to share with the internet community.  

## Archaeological Social Media

Engagement is another issue in the field of archaeology.  3d modeling and photogrammetry have the potential to create an interactive and engaging tool for sharing messages of archaeology with the public.  In order to accomplish this, a connection to the community must be built.  When I say connection, I mean both between archaeologists and the community; along with more communication between archaeologists in general.  The connect between Archaeologists stems from educational institutions, personal connections, and through peer reviewed journals.  In order to gain proper communication between all parties, I suspect that there will be a form of web connection that incorporates all current archaeological studies. This may not happen within the next 5 years, but I propose that there will be a form of social media for the field of archaeology.  Archaeologists, among other professionals use LinkedIn as a professional form of social networking, and one can only assume some make use of other forms of social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram ect.).  These are well known and far reaching websites that allow for social and professional connection.  I searched far and wide, though the community on LinkedIn as far as Anthropology/Archaeology) are concerned are limited.  Digital archaeology is something I had never considered before taking a digital archaeology class at UVIC.  Having a professional outlet that allows for connection can be a great benefit, and having a personalized website for Anthropologists and Archaeologists alike would increase the basis for communication.


Below is an example of what an archaeological social media focused page could look like.
