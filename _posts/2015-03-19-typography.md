# An Example of the Future in Digital Technologies Application to Archaeolgy

Photogrammetry is a technology based photography system that takes multiple pictures of a single object or landscape and through technologies such as Autodesk on can create a 3-dimensional portrayal of the desired image compilation.  This technology is not new, though in the next 5 years there are possibilities for the advancement of photogrammetry.  The current created images through photogrammetry are getting larger and more complex, even to the point of creating 3d images of the side of mountains.  Other developments in the field of photogrammetry are looking at the possibilities of underwater images (Drap 2013).  Examples of underwater photography of archaeological sites have been through excavations by scuba divers, and even the use of submarines floating above archaeological sites have been attempted in Turkey (Drap 2013, 381).  The experiments of underwater photogrammetry have produced images of artifacts on the floors of the ocean with the aid of Remara 2000 submarines (Drap 2013, 385).  Photogrammetry can go one step further with the introduction of 360 degree cameras.  The introduction of 360 degree cameras would allow for the imaging of caves, landscape and archaeological exhibits for a full immersive experience.  The idea behind this interactive tour system stems from the simple 360 camera work of google maps.  In the case of google maps, Iâ€™m sure many of you have seen the smart cars with cameras mounted on top.   With stable cameras through exhibits of cave art, there would be a similar walkthrough pattern of terrestrial exhibits.  Additionally, through the digital technologies, there would be ample space for explanations and facts one could click on for more information (just like google maps).

Armin Gruen is an expert in the field of photogrammetry, and through his experience has come up with 3 techniques for matching images in a photogrammetric scenario.  

### Gruen's 3 techniques
1. intensity-based
2. feature-based
3. relational

### Gruen's techniques explained
- In intensity-based matching the original, or slightly modified (enhanced), image data is used in the form of a matrix of grey values. The most prominent methods are cross-correlation and least squares matching (LS matching or LSM), which are also called area-based matching. (Gruen 2012, 37)
- Feature-based matching requires, firstly, the extraction of basic image features, such as patches, corners, junctions, edges and so on. In a second step, matching is performed between these features. (Gruen 2012, 38)
- Relational matching uses geometric or other relations between features and structures (combination of features). (Gruen 2012, 38)

Applying these techniques with multiple cameras taking multiple images opposed to one camera taking a number of images to create a 3d image will allow for a new way of viewing and accessing archaeological sites and exhibits.
Issues surrounding the creation of 3d camera imaging in archaeology may stem from expense.  In fact, many archaeologists regard photogrammetry to be highly expensive (Fussell 1982, 171).  The benefit for a future in digital archaeology is that the technologies are widely available and becoming less expensive at a rapid pace.  In fact, there are small sets of 360 degree cameras that mount GoPros for just over $300 USD.  The device requires 6 GoPros, but is much less expensive than the multi thousand dollar 360 cameras used in the entertainment industry.

With a lower cost, and the ability to create virtual and interactive tours in a 3d manner.  There is a real possibility of implementing this technology within the coming years.  These are a few of the Paleolithic art sites that 360-degree photogrammetry could be used in.

## The Goal
The purpose of taking 360-degree photogrammetry is to make archaeology more engaging for younger viewers.  The excavation of archaeology is certainly what draws many to the field, though there is not a lot of opportunity to see what really goes on at, and during archaeological excavation.  Below is the one 360 camera work that I was able to track down.  I recommend you open the video into full screen, then click your mouse and drag it around to view around the archaeological site.

The main goal of using digital technologies in archaeology is to create the engaging and informative portrayal of what archaeology is.  To engage the general population, archaeology must keep up with the technological advancements and platforms to market ourselves to the public.  Without the support of public interest, funding for new archaeological investigation will be more difficult (in an already low funded area of academia).  Archaeologists need to keep relevant and ensure that our knowledge is shared with those who want to learn, and and continue to share our knowledge of the past with the public.
