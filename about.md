## About
My name is Jeffrey Wilson, an anthropology student at the University of Victoria.  Throughout the semester my class and I have explored the world of digital archaeology, especially in application of digital technologies in the field of archaeology.  Archaeology has come a long way in terms of digital technology uses, though there are many avenues in which archaeology could venture towards.  Photogrammetry is a digital technology that can be used for taking 3d images, though this project focuses on the future of photogrammetry, and possible uses it could give the archaeological community.

Archaeology is traditionally known as an academic discipline.  Throughout the development of capitalist economies and digital technologies, there is a development in the field of archaeology.   Digital archaeology is a platform in which archaeologists can create interactive and engaging experience for the general public, not just the archaeology community.  There are multiple ways that archaeologists can convey the message of their experiences in a concise and fun way for people to enjoy.  The future of archaeology must include the uses of digital technologies to reach out the general public, and build interest for future archaeologists.
